    "aboutText": "Welcome to the TAMS Club Calendar! This is a simple web app that displays all the student organization events at TAMS, along with a list of clubs and other resources. Our vision is a community-maintained resource that’s available to anyone and can be updated by anyone as well.\nWe are an open-source project, meaning that anyone and everyone can help contribute to the development of the website! You can go to the Github repository where this project is being hosted, where there's more information on that page about how to contribute and help code. If you can't code and still want to help, there is a feedback form below where you can write whatever you would like! The way programs like these get better, after all, is through independent user feedback. Thank you once again for checking out tams.club, and we hope you enjoy the rest of your day! :D",

For the most part, TAMS students would use the schedule and calendar views to see upcoming club events. Club execs would use the events section to create and edit their clubs events, as well as make room reservations. Volunteering and club resources are provided as a reference for students who want to familiarize themselves with or find new clubs/volunteering."

            "text": "The schedule view of events is the home page of the site. When the user enters for the first time, they are greeted by a list of upcoming events. The sidebar on the home page can be used to access certain external links, such as an exam calendar or club leader resources. The navbar at the very top is used to navigate to other sections of the site. The view switcher floating above the event list can be used to switch to calendar or reservation views.\nWhen the user clicks on a specific event, they are taken to a separate event info page that displays more information about the event in an easier-to-read format. The event card contains the type of event, the event name, the club associated with the event, the location, the description, and the start/end times. For repeating events, there is a note regarding how long the event will repeat for. \nThe calendar view will display all events, including past events, in a calendar-like view. You can click on specific days to see what events are happening on those days, as most boxes don’t fit the amount of things on those days!\nFinally, the reservation view is specifically for reservations. When creating events, you may select that an event ONLY be displayed on the reservation calendar. This way, it won’t show up on the public calendar or event list, but will show up as a room reservation (preventing people from reserving the room as well)."
        },
        {
            "section": "Creating and Editing Events",
            "text": "On the home page, there is a green add button at the bottom right. This can be clicked on to add an event. You must log in to create an event, but anyone is free to create an event once logged in. A form will appear to enter your event details. The location refers to the room and will create a reservation (see below). Events by default are private and are not displayed on the schedule view. This is because many “events” are simply room reservations. The system is designed so clubs can create a repeating room reservation in advance and change it to a public event later.\nIf you have created an event, you can edit that event by clicking on the orange edit button on the event info page for that event. This will only show up if it is an event you have created yourself. Make the necessary changes and press “Submit” to update your event.\nRepeating events can be created by checking the “Repeats Weekly” box on an event. There is currently no way to change an existing non-repeating event to repeat weekly. Once you have selected “Repeats Weekly”, a date picker will appear, allowing you to choose how long your event repeats for. There is technically no limit on the number of repeated instances you may have, but be considerate of everyone else using the site.\nWhen editing repeating events, you may either edit all repeating instances (such as changing the name of all the repetitions) or edit a single instance (if we need to change the time of only one week). If a repeating instance is edited individually, it will be “detached” from the other repeating instances. That means that editing “all repeating instances” will not edit the “detached” instance. This is the most efficient implementation of a repeating system that still allows for significant repeating event capabilities. You may also delete individual repeating events or delete all instances of a repeating event."

These reservations can be found on the reservation calendar, which is an hourly view of all rooms, where each table represents a single day of the week. Note that this is accessed through the view switcher at the top of the home page. The graphical layout of the calendar is to help club execs and organizers decide where and when to plan their events.\nYou may also click on a room on the left-hand side of the reservation calendar to see the events that are happening in that specific room. The room-specific reservation calendar will display all events in that room across the span of a month.\nIf a room is reserved in a specific time slot and other events wish to reserve that room in the same time slot, the later organizer will get an error when creating their event. If you are trying to create an event that overlaps a pre existing event, you should discuss the issue with the creator of the first event. There is currently no priority system on reservations, and we rely on students to maintain an equitable reservation system."

The key feature of volunteering cards are the 4 possible filters that the user can choose to show. These are “limited spots”, “semester-long commitment”, “set time slots”, and “repeats weekly”. On the grid view, these cards can easily be filtered by said filters, as well as sorted by name or club name alphabetically."

However, the club page will also display a thumbnail of each club’s banner. Clicking on a club card will bring the user to a more detailed view of the club’s information. At the top, the club’s name and banner are proudly displayed. The club description and list of links are listed below that. The tab switcher at the bottom will switch between execs and committees tabs, which will show cards for each exec and committee. Execs can write a short bio about themselves and attach a profile picture. Committees can have a title, description, and external links."

Users are also able to go to the main edit page and see a list of buttons that will take them to the same creation page. When viewing a specific resource, the add button changes to an edit icon button. Clicking this will allow the user to edit the given resource.\nNot all resources can be created/edited by all users. There are certain access levels that guarantee a more secure site. By default, all logged in users have a “standard” access level and can create/edit events. However, you may only edit and delete events that you have created yourself. There is also a “clubs” and “admin” access level, which have more permissions such as editing clubs/volunteering resources.\nWhen editing a resource, you also have the option to delete that resource. This is done by clicking on the red “Delete [Resource]” button at the bottom right corner of the page. A popup will appear warning you that deletion is irreversible. Click “Delete” once again to confirm and delete the event.\nThe main edit page will also show a list of recent edits made across the site. Clicking on one of these links will bring you to a list of all edits made to that specific resource. This page can also be accessed when editing the resource via the “Show Edit History” button on the bottom left corner. Each edit made will show the previous data state compared to the new data state, essentially showing what has changed and the before/after of those fields."

At the bottom, there is a list of all events you have made, and you can click on each event to go to its detailed view.\nThe admin dashboard is accessible through a button that will only show up on the dashboard if the user has the “admin” access level. The dashboard contains 4 main sections. The first is a place to edit/add/remove external links. The second is a tabular view of all resources across the site. The third is a place to manage user access levels. The final section contains all the feedback collected from users."
